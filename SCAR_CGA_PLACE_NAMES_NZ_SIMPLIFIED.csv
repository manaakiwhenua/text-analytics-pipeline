In 1898 Sir George Newnes sponsored the first British Antarctic Expedition, 1898-1900, which was led by Borchgrevink. The vessel used was the ""Southern Cross"". The party of 10 men left at Cape Adare was the first to spend a winter on the Antarctic Continent. Being restricted in movement through failure to penetrate inland, and because of the ice conditions along the coast, only local exploration and naming was accomplished before the return of the ship. The coast was followed to Cape Washington, and a landing was made on Coulman Island and at the foot of Mt Melbourne. Wood Bay was found to run much further inland than Ross had supposed, and the large feature of the Lady Newnes Ice Shelf was discovered and named. Some thick reindeer moss was found near Mt Melbourne. Landing were made at Franklin Island and at Cape Crozier, and the Ross Ice Shelf was found to have receded some 30 miles since Ross discovered it in 1841.

The name Ferrar Glacier was originally applied both to the part of this glacier below its right turn and to the Taylor Glacier, while the upper part above Knobhead was called South Arm. Taylor, of the BAE, 1910-13, found evidence that there are not two parts of a single glacier but two glaciers apposed. With this discovery Scott gave the names Ferrar Glacier and Taylor Glacier essentially as now applied. Later, on the map included in the scientific reports of the expedition, the names Lower Ferrar Glacier and Upper Ferrar Glacier were applied to these two ice streams, but this naming does not seem consistent with the evidence fo the medial morraines on this map, which show that Taylor Glacier does not flow into the Ferrar Glacier. Since it is apparent from the fairly detailed maps that the main flow of the Ferrar Glacier heads in the plateau somewhere to the south-west of Knobhead, the name Ferrar Glacier is applied above as well as below the turn at Knobhead.",NZL,-77.7667,163,POINT (163 -77.766667),4539,New Zealand,554

The western half is covered with silt and raised moraine material, is deeply cut by thaw streams, and is scarreted with bastions of pinnacled ice which, in the upper reaches, attain a height of 18m. The eastern side of the glacier is smoother, but contains long undulations, icefalls, ridges and gullies. There is no rock wall bordering this side of the glacier, the ice merging imperceptibly with the slopes of Brown Island, Mt Discovery and Mt Morning. About 15 miles southward of Cape Chocolate, the Koettlitz Glacier reaches sea level, having here a width of 8 miles. From this point it continues as a floating sheet of stagnant ice into McMurdo Sound. This ice barrier has a height from 1.5 to 8 m, but the contours and limits undergo considerable change from year to year.
